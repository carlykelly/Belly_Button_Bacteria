Plotly

This assignment was completed as part of the George Washington University Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp.

In order to view the case assignment you will first have to open your command prompt. Next, navigate to the folder on your computer where the json and `index.html` files are stored. In this repository that is the "Solution" folder. Then in your command prompt enter `python -m http.server`. This will allow a local server to be set up on your computer so the data files can be read in using `d3.json`. Now on your web browser go to localhost:8000 (if your command prompt returns a different port use this number instead).
